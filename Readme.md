# Rust web text editor

Experiment building a web text editor using the DOM API and rust bindgen

## Aim of this project

The main goal of this project is to get to know the `wasm_bindgen` & `web_sys` libraries and to experiment with some architectures to build complex frontend applications with it.  
This said I would like to build a decent text area distributable in NPM with a good API that would allow to build other tools on top of it.
